Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Fraudulent transactions pose a significant challenge for financial systems, as they can result in major financial losses and reduced trust among users. This project implements a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, focusing on handling class imbalance and ensuring high detection accuracy.

📌 Project Overview

Developed an end-to-end ML pipeline for fraud detection.

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE and undersampling techniques.

Applied multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Evaluated performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC.

Final model optimized for high recall to minimize undetected fraud cases.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

XGBoost

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions with a heavy imbalance.

Fraudulent transactions: very rare compared to normal ones

Applied resampling techniques to balance the dataset

Performed feature scaling and preprocessing before training
